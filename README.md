# Genetic Algorithms in AI – CS212 Course Project

This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence module (CS212) at Helwan National University – Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology. The objective was to implement and analyze Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for solving real-world combinatorial optimization problems.

## 📌 Project Description

Genetic Algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection. In this project, we focused on solving classic AI-related optimization problems using GAs, such as:

- Faculty Timetable Scheduling
- Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
- 0-1 and Unbounded Knapsack Problem
- Function Optimization (benchmark functions)

Each implementation was developed using Python, and evaluated in terms of performance, convergence, and flexibility.

## 🧠 AI Concepts Applied

- **Evolutionary Computing**
- **Genetic Algorithms**
- Selection, Crossover, Mutation, and Elitism strategies
- Optimization heuristics
- Representation of chromosomes and fitness functions
